# Commuter Mapping

Mapping commuter rates from metro area census tracts. Using LODES data from the census, I'm able to map out and compare rates of traditional commuters, reverse commuters and other patterns by metro area, for MSAs over 250,000 people. 

Live project (WIP) is here: https://commuter-mapping.samlearner.com/
